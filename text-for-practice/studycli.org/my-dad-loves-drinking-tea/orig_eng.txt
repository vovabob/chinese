My dad is a doctor and this year, he’s 60 years old. He doesn’t like drinking water, but he loves drinking tea. He drinks tea when the weather is hot and he drinks tea when the weather is cold.

He drinks tea while working, while watching movies, while taking taxis, while talking on the phone and while eating. He likes drinking tea with his friends and he also likes drinking tea alone.

He loves drinking tea so much that he drinks it every day, and every day he drinks quite a lot of it.

When I drink tea, I can’t sleep, but when he doesn’t drink tea, he can’t sleep. One day we didn’t have any more tea in the house so he couldn’t sleep for a whole day. He says that he can’t live without tea.
