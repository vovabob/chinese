My family has a three-year-old dog named Rice. In the afternoon on Monday, August 6, 2018, my mom and I caught sight of Rice in front of a shop. The weather was quite hot that day and he looked like he really wanted to drink some water. I didn’t have any water, so I gave him an apple to eat. After eating the apple, he wanted to eat another, so he came home with us.

Rice likes to watch TV and eat fruit, and he also really loves to eat rice. When I’m not at home, he likes to sleep. When I’m at home, he likes to sit on the table and look at my computer. On Sunday last week, Rice and I went to the store to do some shopping and he met a beautiful little cat. Now, they often play together.

Rice is our friend and we all like him.
