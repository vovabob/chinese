ChatGPG:

Pythonâ€™s sorted() function, when applied to strings or lists of strings 
(which include Chinese characters), sorts them according to their Unicode
code points.

Collation Order:

* Unicode Code Point Order: The collation order used by default is based on 
Unicode code points. This means the characters are sorted numerically by 
their code points, which may not align with any culturally intuitive or 
language-specific order.

* Locale Settings: While your locale is set to en_NZ.UTF-8, this setting does not affect the default behavior of sorted(). The sorting will still be based on Unicode code points unless you explicitly use a locale-aware sorting function.

* If you need to sort Chinese characters according to a specific collation 
order (like Pinyin order or radical-stroke order), you would need to use 
additional libraries such as PyICU or implement a custom sorting function.
